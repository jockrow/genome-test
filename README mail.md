Hi, David!

Thank you for your interest in the Tech Lead job opportunity.

I'm sending you a technical test as an initial step, to measure your knowledge and be able to move to the next step. Please complete the next test within 48 hours.

Good luck!

Please show us your strengths/skills by building anything you'd like using data from Torre. The goal is for us to get an idea of your skills/strengths in the areas of web development, software architecture, algorithms, innovation, strategic thinking, autonomy, learning, attention to detail, and communication.

â†’ We'll be evaluating your potential in both front and back end development, giving more relevance to the back end. It should be done using Javascript. Using Typescript gives you extra points.

You can access these endpoints:
- GET https://torre.bio/api/bios/$username (gets bio information of $username)
- GET https://torre.co/api/opportunities/$id (gets job information of $id)
- POST https://search.torre.co/opportunities/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate] and https://search.torre.co/people/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate] (search for jobs and people in general, you can see how it's being used here: https://torre.co/search).

Create a search, redesign the genome, redesign the job listings, perform data analysis, develop new functionality, etc. Long story short: anything you would like to build.

You can invest as much time as you'd like. Please log your progress. You have 48 hours to complete it.

Your deliverables are: (Mandatory)
- A link for us to test what you built
- Your progress log
- A way for us to review your code through a control version system (for example, Github) where we can review your incremental progress
- Anything else you'd like to share with us.

Please provide your final test at this link
